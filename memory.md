# Development Kit Project Memory

## Published Baseline

- **Current published release:** v0.11.1 (30 September 2026).
- **Package version on `main`:** 0.11.1 until the next explicit versioned release.
- **Core lifecycle:** `UNDERSTAND → DEFINE → DESIGN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REVIEW → SIMPLIFY → COMPLETE`.
- **Public command surface:** 16 workflow commands.
- **Engineering skills:** 48.
- **Primary position:** DKF is the reliability control plane for agentic software development — **AI can write it. DKF proves it.**

## Published v0.11.1 Reliability Controls

- Development Contracts with authoritative-source fingerprints.
- Independent verification and deterministic `BLOCKED / PENDING / ACCEPTED` acceptance.
- Required-control/reviewer coverage, architecture-drift detection and source-staleness protection.
- Execution-safety and blast-radius controls with preserved human approval gates.
- Bounded correction and canonical artifact reconciliation.
- DKF Design Authority and `design.md` governance.
- DK Intelligence & Memory and DK Control Center.
- Numbered Decision Interface and structured suggestion promotion.
- **Secrets & Configuration Readiness Gate** (v0.11.0): fail-closed configuration handling, zero-credential AI-context exposure, Git tracking protection and release blocking for unresolved release-critical configuration.
- **Live UI Preview & Visual Verification** (v0.11.1): UI-context preview arming, declared dev-server start/reuse, provider-neutral browser opening, ownership-safe shutdown and VERIFY-stage browser evidence.
- **Token & Context Efficiency Hardening** (v0.11.1): section-aware source materialization, token profiles, compact role contexts and CI token budgets.

## Integrated Post-v0.11.1 Mainline Work

### Development Modes

Integrated through PR #53; Issue #50 is completed.

- Modes: Rapid, Balanced, Specification-Driven, Documentation-Driven and Maintenance & Evolution.
- Project mode state is revisioned, persisted and explicitly change-controlled.
- Mode policy affects specification/artifact/planning depth but cannot weaken mandatory DKF controls.
- New Development Contracts bind an immutable mode snapshot and fingerprint; later mode changes affect future contracts only.
- Historical pre-v0.11 PRs #42/#43 are archival evidence and must not be merged directly.
- Final PR #53 validation passed the full Ubuntu and Windows `npm run release:validate` matrix.

### IDEA Authority Hardening

Integrated through PR #54; Issue #51 is completed.

- Requirements carry explicit provenance: USER_STATED, USER_CONFIRMED, AI_PROPOSED, RESEARCH_DERIVED or ASSUMED.
- Authoritative requirement/question/scope/design/approval transitions require explicit Product Owner authority.
- IDEA presents one persisted numbered interaction at a time and requires its exact fingerprint for consumption.
- Discovery uses journal-first, hash-chained persistence with safe restart recovery and corruption fail-closed behavior.
- Interaction consumption uses hash-chained receipts to prevent replay.
- Design applicability/disposition is Product Owner-bound; caller-supplied mock authority state is not accepted.
- Canonical `docs/01-concept/idea-brief.md` approval is bound to exact artifact, discovery and design fingerprints.
- Direct edits, stale source changes, replay attempts and authority-chain corruption invalidate or block progression.
- Historical PR #35 is archival behavioral evidence and must not be merged directly.
- Final PR #54 validation passed the full Ubuntu and Windows `npm run release:validate` matrix, including the dedicated IDEA adversarial suite.

## Repository Reconciliation

- Historical draft PRs #12, #35, #42 and #43 are closed and preserved only as archival evidence.
- Production-readiness Issue #44 is closed as superseded by the v0.11.1 release.
- Development Modes Issue #50 and IDEA Authority Issue #51 are completed and closed.
- Canonical README, strategy, roadmap, release notes and changelog distinguish **published v0.11.1** from post-release functionality integrated on `main`.
- GitHub Actions are maintained on the current major versions identified by repository dependency automation to avoid deprecated action runtimes.
- Remote historical branches may remain until branch refs are explicitly deleted; their existence is not authority for current implementation state.

## Release Discipline

- Green automated tests alone do not authorize publication.
- Do not claim post-v0.11.1 mainline functionality is published until version, tag, GitHub Release and package publication gates are explicitly completed.
- After any release-impacting change, run the full release-validation/package-consumer gates on the final merge base and verify the published distribution.
